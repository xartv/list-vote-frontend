## Installation and running

1. Clone the project and install the dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xartv/list-vote-frontend.git
```

```bash
cd list-vote-frontend/
npm i
```

2. Create a .env file in the root of the project and copy the following code into it
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROTOCOL=http
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=localhost
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PORT=3002
NEXT_PUBLIC_COOKIE_DOMAIN=localhost
```

3. NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PORT and NEXT_PUBLIC_PROTOCOL are the URL, PORT and PROTOCOL of the running backend. NEXT_PUBLIC_COOKIE_DOMAIN is domain for setting cookies. If you haven't changed anything during its launch, the values mentioned above should default to suitable settings. Otherwise, you will need to adjust them.

4. Alright, all that's left is to start the application
```bash
npm run dev
```
5. So you can find the running application at http://localhost:3000 üèÜ

üêà *For the full functioning of the entire project, it is recommended to also run the backend application https://github.com/xartv/list-vote-backend*
